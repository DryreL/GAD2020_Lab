# GAD2020 Lab

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the **GAD2020** course at **Bahçeşehir University**. The objective was to level design a **maze** and implement two key mechanics to enhance the gameplay experience. This project provided hands-on practice with game development, focusing on basic interaction and navigation mechanics.

## Project Overview

In this project, we created a maze game where players navigate a dark environment, enhanced by two key mechanics:

1. A **flashlight toggle** to control visibility.
2. A **minimap** to help players navigate through the maze more efficiently.

These mechanics were essential for enhancing the player's experience, providing control over the environment while maintaining the challenge of navigating through the maze.

## Mechanics Implemented

1. **Flashlight Mechanic**: Players can turn the flashlight on or off, adding an element of strategy and difficulty to navigating the maze.
   
2. **Minimap Mechanic**: A functional minimap helps players view the layout of the maze from a top-down perspective, making navigation easier.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots from the project:

## Installation & Setup

To explore the project:

1. Install **Unity 6** (prefably LTS) or later.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the project in Unity.
4. Press `Play` in the Unity Editor to test and explore the mechanics.

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can explore the following:

- Toggle the flashlight on/off using a **LMB** button.
- Use the minimap to navigate through the maze.
- Experiment with adjusting the mechanics or the layout of the maze to enhance your understanding of game development concepts.

## Features

- **Level Design**: The maze is designed to challenge the player's navigation skills.
- **Lighting Mechanic**: The flashlight mechanic adds tension by limiting visibility, making the exploration more engaging.
- **Minimap Mechanic**: A dynamic minimap helps players navigate through the maze by showing an overview of the layout.

## Dependencies

- **Unity 6 LTS** (or newer)
- **C# Scripting**: For game mechanics implementation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are a few troubleshooting tips:

1. **Project Won’t Open**: Ensure you are using **Unity 6 LTS** or newer.
2. **Mechanics Not Working**: Double-check the script settings in the Unity editor and ensure all required components are active in the scene.
